# WEB_DOCKER

This is my first simple web project made with **Docker**.Itâ€™s a very simple project, but it helped me understand how Docker works.

### What I did
1. Created a small HTML page (`index.html`).
2. Wrote a `Dockerfile` using the official **Nginx** image to serve my page.
3. Built the Docker image with `docker build`.
4. Ran the container and opened it in the browser at **http://localhost:8080**.
5. Updated my page and rebuilt the image to see the changes.
